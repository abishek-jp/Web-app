<p>Crop Yield Prediction – Theory (Textbook Material)
1. Introduction to Crop Yield Prediction

Crop yield prediction is the process of estimating the amount of agricultural output (such as rice, wheat, millet, etc.) based on historical and environmental factors.
Textbooks on Agricultural Informatics, Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Predictive Analytics describe crop yield prediction as a supervised regression problem, where:

Inputs (features) → rainfall, fertilizer use, soil type, pesticides, crop type, temperature, area sown, etc.

Output (label) → crop yield (often measured in tons/hectare or kg/hectare).

Crop yield models are essential for:

Food security planning

Agricultural policy formation

Smart farming

Market forecasting

2. Feature Engineering in Agricultural Prediction

Standard agricultural ML literature states that crop yield depends on:

✅ Climatic Features

Annual rainfall

Minimum / Maximum / Mean temperature

Monsoon onset / retreat

Humidity

✅ Soil & Land Features

Soil type (Black soil, Red soil, Alluvial, etc.)

pH of soil

Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium levels

Soil moisture

✅ Cultivation Features

Fertilizer usage

Insecticide & pesticide usage

Crop type (rice, wheat, maize…)

Area under cultivation

Our model uses:

Crop name

State

Season

Area

Production

These features match standard textbook features used in agricultural yield prediction with ML.

3. Machine Learning Methods for Crop Yield Prediction

Textbooks classify ML methods for crop prediction into:

✅ Linear Regression Models

Simple, interpretable, but cannot capture non-linear relationships.

✅ Decision Tree Models

Good for categorical features, capture non-linear patterns.

✅ Ensemble Models (used in your project)

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) ✔️ This is what our project uses.

These models handle:

Large datasets

Nonlinear interactions

Missing values

Categorical variables (with encoding)

4. XGBoost Algorithm (Prescribed content summary)

XGBoost is an optimized implementation of Gradient Boosting.

Key textbook principles:

Models are built sequentially

Each new tree corrects errors of previous trees

Uses loss function + regularization (L1 & L2)

Extremely fast due to parallelization + tree pruning

Avoids overfitting via shrinkage (learning rate) and column sampling

Why XGBoost is good for crop yield prediction:

✅ Handles heterogeneous data (numbers + categories)
✅ Works well even with noisy agricultural data
✅ High accuracy compared to classical methods
✅ Supports feature importance ranking

5. One-Hot Encoding (as used in our notebook)

Textbook explanation:
Categorical features such as Season, Crop, State cannot be fed directly into ML models.

One-Hot Encoding converts them into binary columns:

Example:
Season = “Kharif” → [1,0,0]
Season = “Rabi” → [0,1,0]

Our notebook uses SciKit-Learn OneHotEncoder, which is standard.</p>
